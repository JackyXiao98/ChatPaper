6. Summary:

- (1): The research background of this article is differential privacy, which is a strong privacy-preserving concept that has been widely used in data sharing scenarios. Differential privacy can protect individuals' privacy while providing accurate data analysis results. 

- (2): Past methods used for differential privacy are mostly based on fixed mechanisms or randomized mechanisms. However, these methods either limit the application scenarios or do not have the optimal performance. The approach proposed in this paper is well-motivated because it overcomes the limitations of past methods and provides an adaptive and iterative mechanism that adjusts the privacy budget dynamically.

- (3): The research methodology proposed in this paper is an adaptive and iterative mechanism for differential privacy that can adjust the privacy budget based on the application scenario and data volumes. The mechanism makes use of the randomization method and the logarithmic mechanism to ensure the utility of the data analysis result while providing privacy protection.

- (4): The proposed method is evaluated on both synthetic datasets and real-world datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better accuracy and has a lower false negative rate compared to existing methods. Moreover, the performance of the proposed method can support their goals of providing accurate data analysis results while preserving privacy.





8. Conclusion:

- (1): The significance of this work lies in proposing an adaptive and iterative mechanism for differential privacy that can dynamically adjust the privacy budget based on data volumes and application scenarios. This mechanism overcomes the limitations of existing methods and ensures both privacy protection and data utility in data sharing scenarios.

- (2): In terms of innovation point, the proposed mechanism introduces an adaptive and iterative approach to differential privacy that adjusts the privacy budget based on data volumes and application scenarios. In terms of performance, the proposed mechanism achieves better accuracy and a lower false negative rate compared to existing methods. In terms of workload, the proposed mechanism requires additional computation resources to adjust the privacy budget iteratively, which may increase the computational cost. Overall, the strengths of this article are its innovative approach and improved performance, while its potential weakness is increased workload.
